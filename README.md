# ehrlichCodeChallenge
This is a small project created for the Enrlich 24-hour Code Challenge.

Vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript
Ecommerce Landing Page with Shopping Cart

For this project, the following libraries were used:

Bootstrap v5.3
JQuery v3.7
Google Fonts (for the Montserrat font)

These dependencies were imported via their official CDNs.

For the data storage, I opted to use the browser's application storage as this was meant to be a self-contained project.

This project includes a fully functional Shopping Cart feature. The following functionalities are implemented:

1. Ability to add an item to the cart.
2. Ability to remove cart items.
3. Ability to modify the quantity of items added to the cart.
4. Prices are computing based on the cart interactions.

Thank you!
